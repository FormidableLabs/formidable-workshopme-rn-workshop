## Getting started

For this workshop, the lessons are located in the `src` folder of this repo. Switching from lesson to lesson involves modifying the import in `src/index.js` to point at the folder of the lesson we are working on. Take a look in `src` to identify how this works. You will be prompted at the beginning of each lesson to switch to the current lesson in `src/index.js`.
